# Daegu-Groundwater-Quality-Analysis
Spatiotemporal analysis and forecasting of groundwater quality for the Daegu National Industrial Complex using AI models.

Rationale for Sensor Selection
1. General Rationale
To select an optimal monitoring network for this study, the following criteria were comprehensively considered:

Data Homogeneity: To consistently analyze the water quality of the deep bedrock aquifer, wells monitoring the same hydrogeological unit were prioritized. The selected wells—Daegu Nongong (Bedrock), Daegu Hyeonpung (Bedrock), and Daegu Guji (Deep)—provide data from deep strata, enhancing the reliability of comparisons and modeling.

Relevance to Research Objective: The primary goal is to assess and predict the impact of industrial activities on groundwater quality. Therefore, wells located within and around the industrial complex were chosen for their sensitivity to potential pollution sources.

Data Availability and Reliability: Wells with sufficient historical data and stable measurement quality were selected to ensure the construction of a suitable dataset for time-series analysis and model training.

2. Triangulation Methodology
The triangulation network was configured using the three selected wells (Daegu Nongong_Sin, Daegu Hyeonpung, Daegu Guji 2-ri) for the following reasons:

Spatial Representativeness: By arranging the monitoring wells in a triangular formation, the network effectively encompasses the Daegu National Industrial Complex. This reduces spatial bias and allows for a more generalized analysis, making the results less sensitive to anomalies at a single point.

Groundwater Flow Estimation: Triangulation is a fundamental method for estimating the direction of groundwater flow using data from at least three points. This provides critical information for understanding changes in water quality and tracking the movement of contaminants.

Enhanced Model Input: Spatially distributed data helps AI/ML models learn diverse spatial patterns, which can contribute to improved performance and accuracy in predictive modeling.
